      "Kepler-20e is a small exoplanet located in the Kepler-20 system and is one of the first known planets to orbit in the habitable zone of a star.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "It has a rocky surface, and its proximity to its star likely makes the planet too hot to support life as we know it.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "Kepler-20e completes one full orbit in just six days and is part of a multi-planet system discovered by NASA's Kepler mission.",

    name: "Kepler-20f",
    image: kepler20f,
    primary_description:
      "Kepler-20f is a super-Earth that lies in the habitable zone of its star, making it an interesting target for further study.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "While it's larger than Earth, its atmosphere and surface conditions remain unknown, making it a subject of speculation for astronomers.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "Kepler-20f is in a planetary system with several other exoplanets, offering valuable insight into the diversity of worlds around distant stars.",

    name: "Kepler-1649c",
    image: kepler1946c,
    primary_description:
      "Kepler-1649c is a potentially habitable exoplanet located about 300 light-years away and has similar characteristics to Earth.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "It orbits its star at a distance where liquid water could potentially exist, sparking interest in its capacity to support life.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "Kepler-1649c's star is a red dwarf, which means it may experience flare activity that could impact the planetâ€™s habitability.",

    name: "GJ 504b",
    image: gj504b,
    primary_description:
      "GJ 504b is a gas giant located around 57 light-years away, notable for its striking pink color and low temperature.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "This young planet is cooler than Jupiter, with methane clouds in its atmosphere that give it a unique pink hue.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "GJ 504b's low temperature is puzzling for a planet its size, and scientists continue to study its unusual characteristics.",

  {
    name: "HR 8799b",
    image: hr8799b,
    primary_description:
      "HR 8799b is one of the first directly imaged exoplanets, located about 129 light-years away, and orbits a young star.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "The planet is massive and orbits far from its star, providing a good view for astronomers using direct imaging techniques.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "HR 8799b is part of a unique planetary system with several other gas giants, all of which have been directly imaged.",

    primary_description:
      "TOI 700 is a nearby star system that hosts three planets, including TOI 700 d, which lies in the habitable zone.",
    lower_secondary_description:
      "TOI 700 d is roughly Earth-sized and orbits within a region where liquid water could exist, making it a strong candidate for further study.",
    upper_secondary_description:
      "This star system is located only 100 light-years away, offering a relatively close target for future exploration and observation.",
